Tasks:


Register form: Some adjustments
I moved the button to inside the form, so I can submit the form pressing enter, that works fine.
So, when I register a new user, I tried to send an alert saying 'Registering...', before it sends the final alert 'Youre all set....'. but the 'Registering' stays there with both alerts.
So I would like for the 'registering' to be changed to 'youre all set...'.
So, user submits register form -> alert 'Registering' appears -> 'registering' changes to 'Youre all set...'.

Also, the registration inputs are not being cleared after submitting form, so I need them to reset if the form is successful.




Like button - After liking the post, the button should look as it is when I hover BEFORE liking it. (Blue background with white text and white thumbs up icon).





Comments button - After sending a comment, the number of comments in the button only updates after I refresh the page. It needs to be real time.
Also, if there is only 1 comment, the button should say ‘1 comment’, without the ’s’ at the end, instead of ‘1 comments’. The like button is already working like this.




Comments - After sending a comment, it is not sending it real time with the comment UI, I have to refresh it to show the new layout.





Implement reply system sort of similar to how current code is.

*I made a table comments_replies to store the replies. But feel free to make any changes you need.



Implement mention users system in comments and replies.

Replies will be only 1 level deep, so that’s why I wanted to implement mention users, because if someone wants to reply to a reply, it would be on the same replies table, under same parent comment, but I would like for the reply input to have the user mentioned in the beginning of the text. (If I’m not explaining right, it is like Instagram does).

So, a User post something -> User2 comments -> User3 replies to the comment -> if User4 replies to the User3's reply, it would look like a reply, but it would have the User3 mentioned in the text as default.
